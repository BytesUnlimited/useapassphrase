## Why should I use a random passphrase?

Because humans are terrible at creating secure passwords. The [famous xkcd comic][1] got it right: humans have been trained to use <b>hard-to-remember</b> passwords that are <b>trivial</b> for computers to guess.

Why are human created passwords so darn guessable? Because we tend to follow predictable patterns. We tend to create passwords that fall into common patterns: passwords based on names, locations, dates or just common English words. Then, we add some spice with a capital letter, some numbers, or a symbol.

Does your password fall into this group?

| Bad Password Patterns | Is It Memorable?  | Time To Crack  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| A common word (example: `december`)| Heck yeah. | Instantaneously. |
| An easily-typed spatial word (example: `qwerty` or `aaaaaaaa`)| Very much so. | Instantaneously. |
| The family dog (example: `rusty`) | Yep. | Instantaneously. |
| An important number, such as a date or zipcode (example: `03261981`)| It's memorable to you, certainly. | Instantaneously. |
| A word with trivial letterâ†’number substitutions (example: `S4nfr4n`)| Sort of memorable, but you may forget which letters are substituted for numbers.| Instantaneously.|

If your password resembles any of these examples, it is _instantly crackable._ Even a mix of these patterns, such as `[common word]+[number]` will be relatively trivial to crack.

Compare those to a passphrase:

| Password Pattern | Is It Memorable?  | Time To Crack  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| Four or more randomly chosen words: (example: `mergers decade labeled manager`) | Type it a few times, and you'll have it committed to memory. | Centuries. Or more.|

## I can come up with an uncrackable password on my own, thanks.

If you try to generate an uncrackable password with your feeble human brain, it will probably look something like this: `f&l9Zqa#1`. That will take centures to crack, but it's a hell of a thing to remember.

But consider this password: `clothing begin afford editors`. That is equally (in fact, more) difficult to crack, and it is readable and easily remembered.

Random passphrases provide the best combination of **<u>security</u>** and **<u>memorability</u>**.

## Fine, you've convinced me. I'll use a passphrase. What else can I do to increase my security?

The receipe for perfect password management is straightforward.

### 1. Use a password manager.

Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer all have built in password managers. But if you plan to use your passwords across devices, you probably should use one of these:

* **1 Password** (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
* **LastPass** (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
* **KeePass** (Linux, Windows, Mac, Android)

### 2. Use a strong master password for your password manager.

This is the perfect opportunity for a passphrase.

### 3. Use a different password for every site.

<span style="color: #000;">belief romanian bridge profit</span>  
<span style="color: #333;">arts started bundle disease</span>  
<span style="color: #666;">delay gradual asset centers</span>  
<span style="color: #999;">keating post warburg johnson</span>  
<span style="color: #AAA;">efforts denying billed buy</span>  
<span style="color: #CCC;">whose category fonts mutual</span>  
<span style="color: #EEE;">easing autonomy weight five</span>

And so on.

## And now I'm getting my password from a website. That seems like a bad practice on its own. Is _this_ page secure?

Yes. This page makes <u>zero</u> calls to external sites or resources (check your network tab to verify). The images and javascript are all embedded.

Unless someone is looking over your shoulder, it's secure.
